Zeeguu is a research project. Our goal is to discover ways in which learning a foreign language is more fun and more effecitve.

The only personal information that we store about you is the name and email you provide on this page. We will share your name and email with only your teacher if you are part of a class. 
We need you email to send you a reset password code, important announcements about the platform, and possibly a survey at some point.

We store anonymized data about your interactions with foreign language texts and vocabulary exercises together with the times of these interactions. 
They help us estimate the words you know, the ones you should learn, recommend texts, and approximate time spent studying.

We might make the anonymized interaction data available for other researchers too. 
In research, data can be even more important than algorithms.
